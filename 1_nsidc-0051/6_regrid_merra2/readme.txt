Here I think you should regrid the MERRA-2 data just like I
did for my 2020 SnowModel Lagrangian simulations and paper.
But to the sea ice concentration projection.

These directories are a copy of the first 4 met processing
steps that I did for that paper.  You don't need to do the
5th and 6th steps which are required for the Lagrangian
SnowModel simulations.

I think you can just work through these directories and steps,
until you understand what I did, and then what you need to
change to fit your application.
