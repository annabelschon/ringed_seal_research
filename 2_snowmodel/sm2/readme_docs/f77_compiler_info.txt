The following are instructions on how to install and test a
free FORTRAN 77 compiler program.

Follow the instructions in Cygwin_FORTRAN_77_Installation.doc
to install g77 or gfortran (basically the same as f77) on
your PC or laptop.

Use a text editor (like WordPad) to create the following test
fortran file:

ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
c testing.f

      x=45.6
      print *, "this is a test, x = ",x

      end
ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

Save the file as testing.f in the directory c:\cygwin\home\.

To compile, in the cygwin /home/ directory, type:

g77 testing.f

or

gfortran testing.f

This creates an a.exe executable file.

To run, type:

./a.exe

One thing you will need to be able to do is edit text files
(.f, .par, etc), with some text editor (like Notepad++),
from your cygwin directory.

To test that you can do this, make testing.f look like:

ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
c testing.f

      x=45.6
      y = 888.9
      print *, "this is a test, x = ",x
      print *, "this is a test, y = ",y

      end
ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

and re-run it:

./a.exe


Note that this cygwin window mimics a unix window.  So you
should be able to issue unix commands, like:

dir (to list the directory contents)

cat filename (to print to the screen)

rm filename (to remove/delete a file)

cd dirname (to change to a specific directory)

cd .. (to go back one directory)

etc.

Please send me any information you have that would allow me
to improve this document.
