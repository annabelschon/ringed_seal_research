1) This example SnowModel simulation runs a small domain, 31 by 31
grid cells, with hourly time steps.  All of the details can be
found in the snowmodel.par file.

2) I suggest making an "archive" directory of this example, so that
you can prove to yourself that your model setup is working
appropriately.  When you are able to reproduce my results, then you
can make the changes required to perform your own simulations.

3) For reference, this simulation took ~3 minutes on my workstation.

4) The simulation produces the following output files:
   a) direct access binary files, outputs at the end of each
   simulation day (see snowmodel.par and snowmodel.f)
     enbal.gdat
     micromet.gdat
     snowpack.gdat
     snowtran.gdat

   b) end-of-day swe distributions for the entire simulation (see
   outputs_user.f)
     swe_depth_2002.10.02.00.asc
     swe_depth_2002.10.03.00.asc
     ...

   c) end-of-hour Tair distributions for the first 24 hours of the
   simulation (see outputs_user.f)
     Tair_2002.10.01.01.asc
     Tair_2002.10.01.02.asc
     ...

5) In addition to a collection of output files, the "figures"
directory provides a summary of this example simulation.  Note that
vegetation and topography figures are also in this directory.
