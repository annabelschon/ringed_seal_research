Examples of how I would do this are available here:

/snowmodel/sm/post_process/mk_3hrly_flt_files/1_mk_SM_flt_nvars_3hrly.f

Note that this is just an old version of what I am doing here:

/snowmodel/sm/post_process/mk_geotiff_files/daily/1_mk_SM_flt_nvars.f

I would just merge the two approaches to create a smarter
way to create the 3hrly .flt and .tif files.
