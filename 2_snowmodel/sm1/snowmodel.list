 You are running the large-domain Barnes oi scheme
   This requires:
   1) no missing data for the fields of interest
   2) no missing stations during the simulation
   3) met file must list stations in the same order
   4) the number of nearest stns used is 9 or less
   5)  **** no error checking for this is done ****

 Generating nearest-station index.  Be patient.
