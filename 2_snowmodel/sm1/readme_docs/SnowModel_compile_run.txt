This document describes the general procedures required to run
SnowModel.

1) SnowModel is written with pretty straight forward FORTRAN 77
commands/code.  So it requires a f77/g77 compiler.  A free compiler
can be found by looking at f77_compiler_info.txt and
Cygwin_FORTRAN_77_Installation.doc.

2) The model requires a met station input file.  See
micromet_input_format.txt.

3) It also requires input topography and vegetation data/files.
See topo_veg_input_format.txt.

4) SnowModel simulations are controlled by the snowmodel.par file;
the model-parameter input file.  You can edit this file with a text
editor (like WordPad).  There are plenty of comments in the .par
file that should guide how you set the simulation up.  Be sure and
read the top of the file for formatting requirements.

5) To compile SnowModel, run the "compile_snowmodel.script" (type
it, or click on it or something, depending on your environment).
This creates an executable called "snowmodel".  Note that if you
are using the Cygwin_FORTRAN_77 compiler listed above, you have to
edit the "compile_snowmodel.script" to use g77 instead of f77, and
you should comment out the lines (put # in front of them):

# filename1=enbal_code.o
# filename2=micromet_code.o
# filename3=preprocess_code.o
# filename4=readparam_code.o
# filename5=snowmodel.o
# filename6=snowpack_code.o
# filename7=snowtran_code.o
#  
# filename8=precipfactor_user.o
# filename9=outputs_user.o
# 
# rm $filename1 $filename2 $filename3 $filename4 $filename5 $filename6 $filename7 $filename8 $filename9

Also, note that I have it set up to put the executable one
directory below the code.

6) To run SnowModel, type snowmodel, or ./snowmodel, or click on
it, depending on your environment.

7) If you want to capture the information that gets sent to the
screen, you can pipe the output to a file, like 
  snowmodel > output.info

8) If you ever make code changes, there is a script in the "code/"
directory that uses the unix "diff" command to compare your working
version with some archived version.

9) Note that, in general, the code is configured with snowmodel_main.f
as the main program, xxxx_code.f are the main subroutines that
should probably not be modified, and xxxx_user.f are the
subroutines that will require user modification if they are used in
the simulation (controlled by the .par file).

10) There are two include files, snowmodel.vars.inc, and
snowmodel.inc.  You probably will not modify the snowmodel.vars.inc
file.  But, the snowmodel.inc file defines the maximum array sizes
allowed in your model simulation.  For example, nx_max=1501 and
ny_max=1501 means that the maximum array sizes in the model
simulation will be 1500 by 1500.  If you change anything in this
file, the model has to be recompiled.  Also note that if, after
compiling the model, it does not run (does not seem to do
anything, no error messages, nothing), it may be that these numbers
make the model larger than your available computer memory.

For reference, the following should give you some guidance on the
domain size you can run for your computer memory:

memory (Gb)    number of grid cells in x and y    number of cells
  0.5                    900 x 900                    800,000
  1.0                   1300 x 1300                 1,700,000
  2.0                   1900 x 1900                 3,600,000
  4.0                   2600 x 2600                 7,000,000

11) Note that because the model does not have a soil/vegetation
model, the surface fluxes (sensible and latent) calculated by the
energy balance model are not generally valid over non-snow
surfaces.  Because of this, they are set to the undefined value
before output.
