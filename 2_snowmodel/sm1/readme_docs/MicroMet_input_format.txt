SnowModel/MicroMet met data input format requirements:


1) The data needs to be in the following format (one file for each
station):

 year   mo   dy    hr     stn_id  easting  northing  elevation   Tair     RH     speed    dir     precip
(yyyy) (mm) (dd) (hh.hh) (number)   (m)       (m)      (m)        (C)    (%)     (m/s)   (deg)    (mm/dt)

 2002   10    1   12.00    101   426340.0  4411238.0  3598.0     0.92    57.77     4.80   238.29 -9999.00
 2002   10    2   12.00    101   426340.0  4411238.0  3598.0    -3.02    78.77 -9999.00 -9999.00 -9999.00
 2002   10    8   12.00    101   426340.0  4411238.0  3598.0    -5.02    88.77 -9999.00 -9999.00 -9999.00
 ...

This is a daily data example.  For hourly data, you will just have
all the hours listed.

These need to be simple ascii text files.  One option is to put
them together in Excel, and then save as a .csv (comma delimited)
file.

I have a program that will take all of the individual station files
and merge them into the required MicroMet met-station input file.

2) The station id number must be a number (not a character), but
you can pick any numbering convention you want.

3) If a particular date exists with some good data (like just tair
that day), any missing data needs a -9999.0 number (or whatever
undefined value you define) in those rows/columns, like listed
above.

4) It is fine to have complete missing dates for any given
station.  What I mean by this is that if you have no data on a
given day, you don't need that line/date (you don't need a line
with all missing data values, like the above example).  But, also
note that it is okay to have lines with all missing data values
(but in this case, the date strings, id, coords, and elev must
still be valid).

5) You have to have at least one station with valid data values.
The model will check for this at the beginning of the model run.

6) If you run the MicroMet preprocessor, the data going into that
must be in the format:

 year   mo   dy    hr       Tair     RH      speed    dir     precip
(yyyy) (mm) (dd) (hh.hh)     (C)     (%)     (m/s)   (deg)    (mm/dt)

 2002   11   24   12.00    -6.33    96.72    18.17   282.27     0.04
 2002   11   25   12.00    -6.46    98.35    20.90   281.22 -9999.00
 2002   11   26   12.00    -6.51    98.33    19.46   282.40     0.23
...

Then, the id, coords, and elevation, will be inserted as part of
running the preprocessor.

7) the easting and northing do not have to be UTM Easting and
Northing coordinate values.  They just need to be some kind of x
and y coordinate values (in meters), and they have to correspond to
the coordinates you define for your distributed topography and
vegetation datasets.  So, for example, you can define the lower
left corner of your topo and veg data to be at x=0.0, y=0.0, and
the station coords need to be defined relative to that starting
coordinate.

8) Please send me any information you have that would allow me to
improve this document.
