# This runs a.out as a background batch (at) job.
#   It does the following:

# 1) saves any errors and a human-readable simulation
#    time (in days, hours, minutes, seconds) to a
#    snowmodel.err file.

# 2) saves any outputs that would normally be printed 
#    to the screen to a snowmodel.list file.

# 3) sends an email to the user when the job is
#    finished.
